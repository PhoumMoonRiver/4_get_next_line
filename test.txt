Hello This is my Test for GNL Project.

Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world
Will keep on turning

Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That we're burning

Lay your head
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine

Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft, across the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find
You ever need me
Don't say a word
About tomorrow, or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head
Upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine

Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me
One more time

For the good times

For the good times.
